# Docker implementation of radius in Centos with Client and Users
The purpose of this project is to start using Radius for authentication, this uses Docker to auto-create the distro that will be used as primary server for authentication
You just have to modify __Dockerfile__ in order to add more users and __clients.conf__ to add your own authenticators

If you have any doubt you could see the [The getting started guide for radius](http://freeradius.org/doc/getting_started.html)
